# Cleaning and Maintenance

For optimal performance and to reduce any experimental issues, it is imperative that the Davis Rig is wiped off from any spills or drips, especially when using sticky solutions such as sucrose. The table, lick block, faceplate, and rods that the table rides on should be wiped down clean on a regular basis or schedule.

## Daily Cleaning After Use:

- **Remove Bottles and Tubes**: Disconnect any bottles and tubes that were in contact with tastants or solutions.
- **Flush Tubes**: Rinse tubes with distilled water to remove any residual solution. Follow this with ethanol (70% isopropyl alcohol) for disinfection, and then flush again with distilled water to avoid residue buildup.
- **Clean Lickometers**: Use cotton swabs and distilled water to gently wipe the lickometer sensors. Be careful not to damage the sensors.
- **Wipe Down Surfaces**: Use ethanol to wipe down surfaces of the rig and surrounding equipment, especially areas where solutions may have splashed.

## Weekly Cleaning:

- **Deep Clean Bottles and Tubes**: Soak tubes and bottles in a mild detergent solution, then rinse thoroughly with distilled water. Allow them to dry completely before reassembling.
- **Inspect Sensors**: Check all sensors for residue buildup and clean with soft materials to avoid scratching or damaging them.

## Monthly Cleaning and Maintenance:

- **Inspect for Corrosion**: Check for signs of corrosion or wear on metal components, and replace any parts as necessary.
- **Disassemble for Thorough Cleaning**: If your rig allows disassembly, once a month disassemble the rig partially to access difficult-to-reach areas for a more comprehensive cleaning.

## Preventive Measures:

- **Filter Water Solutions**: Use distilled or deionized water for any solutions used in the rig to avoid mineral buildup inside the tubes and bottles.
- **Avoid Sticky Solutions**: If you are using sugary or viscous solutions, ensure that the rig is flushed with ethanol followed by distilled water after each session.

For specialized components like peristaltic pumps or the electronics, follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for cleaning. Proper cleaning helps maintain equipment accuracy and extends its lifespan.

## Sensitivity Calibration / Maintenance

1. Remove the lick block by lifting upwards.
2. Clean and remove any residue from the lick block and faceplate in a sink with soap and water.
3. Wipe/dry the lick block thoroughly and allow to air dry.
4. Clean the table and around the banana plug with alcohol wipes; clean black bar underneath the table.
5. Reinstall the lick block to the table and attach the faceplate. Move the table into the experiment position.
6. Turn on the system and turn the sensitivity dial fully counterclockwise (setting 0.0).
7. Increase the 10-turn sensitivity dial clockwise until the amber “lick” LED stays lit. This reading should be close to the 6.0 setting.
8. Decrease the sensitivity by turning the dial 1 turn counterclockwise from the setting in step 7.
9. Run a trial experiment and observe the lick count during the door cycle. If the lick counter increases with door motion, lower the sensitivity until this has stopped. This should be a very small adjustment.

**Note**: If the sensitivity adjustment dial number is greater than 7 or less than 4 after this procedure, it may indicate a problem. Check for loose wires under the table. Check for sticky residue around the metal box under the front of the table. If liquid has entered the metal box, the table assembly will need to be returned to Med Associates for service.

Ensure to wipe clean the front black bar after each use.
