# Virus and Implant Protocol

### Timeline
- At 300g or 6-12 weeks, bring animal up (ideally around 8-9 weeks for males).
- Give a week to adapt.
- Virus surgery.
- 1 week recovery (2 days of postops + daily weighing, introducing more lap time at day 5).
- 1 week of handling.
- 5 days of BAT training (habituation, 7 days before implant).
- Implant at 21 days after virus.
- 1 week recovery from implant.
- Water dep and run 2 days of 2-bottle (hab4 and hab5 again) or until licking is consistent.
- 3 test days (laser at lick, laser at shutter, no laser; 3 tastes).

## Habituation

### Hab 1
- Rig habituation.
- No shutter or tastants, 30min.
- Fan on.

### Hab 2
- Rig habituation.
- No shutter or tastants, 30min.
- Fan on.
- Water restriction starts.

### Hab 3
- Licking habituation: shutter open with 1 water bottle (`orx_bat_hab3`), 30 min.
- Fan on.
- 4pm: 10-15ml water.

### Hab 4
- 2 bottles of water – 30 trials, 15 for each bottle (`orx_bat_hab4`).
- Fan on.
- 4pm: 10-15ml water.

### Hab 5
- 2 bottles of water – 30 trials, 15 for each bottle (`orx_bat_hab5`).
- Fan on.
- 4pm: 10-15ml water.

## Testing

- After 1 week of recovery from the implant, start water dep.
- Run Hab 4 and Hab 5 again, then experiments.

### Hab 4
- 2 bottles of water – 30 trials, 15 each (`orx_bat_hab4_54`).
- Fan on.
- 4pm: 10-15ml water.

### Hab 5
- 2 bottles of water – 30 trials, 15 each (`orx_bat_hab5_54`).
- Fan on.
- 4pm: 10-15ml water.

### Experiment Start
- Make tastants; turn lasers on 15min prior to start.
- Set laser lines to calibrated output.
- **After putting in the rat**, tape off part of the T roof of box so the laser wire stays in one lane.

### Test 1
- 6 bottles, 2 for each tastant, 9 trials each (9 laser on) = 54 trials.
- Protocol: `Orx_bat_test_1_54.pro`.
- Fan on.
- 4pm: 10mL water.

### Test 2
- Same as Test 1.
- Protocol: `Orx_bat_test_2_54.pro`.

### Test 3
- Same as Test 1.
- Protocol: `Orx_bat_test_3_54.pro`.
- 4pm: 30mL water.

### Test 4 – As Needed
- Same as Test 1.
- Protocol: `Orx_bat_test_4_54.pro`.

## Make Tastants
- **Bottles:**
  - MiliQ water.
  - 0.3M sucrose - 5.17g sucrose/50mL MiliQ.
  - 0.5mM QHCl - 0.00992g QHCl/50mL MiliQ.
  - Store in glass bottles; wrap QHCl in tinfoil, in amber glass bottle.

## Run Experiment
- **Prep:** Make tastants at the start of Test 1.
- **Turn on laser** 15min before, but do not turn key to “on” yet.
- **Fill bottles** appropriately and weigh them before the experiment.

- **Computer setup:** 
  - Use the icon with ‘data collection’ to start.
  - Select .pro file and press ‘show’ to check for the correct number of presentations.
  - Check licks are registering by completing the circuit.
  - Abort and restart the .pro, and press ‘Test’.
  - Leave the program open and ready with the animal name in.

- **Animal in:**
  - Weigh the animal.
  - Place the animal in your lap and connect the optic fibers.
  - Place the animal in the box and secure the lid.

- **Run experiment:**
  - Adjust laser output to match the optic fiber with the lowest output.
  - Press ‘Run’ and monitor the animal and the experiment.
  - Record any mismatched trials.
  
- **After Experiment:**
  - Weigh bottles again and note any changes.
  - Clean the setup with 70% ethanol.
