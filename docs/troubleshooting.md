# Troubleshooting the BAT Rig

## Shutter Not Closing Between Trials
**Q:** I think the shutter on the BAT rig isn’t closing between trials; any idea how to fix that?  
**A:** Unplug the barrel jack connector (power from the wall)into the tan box to the right of the rig with the LED lights and wait a couple of minutes, then try again.

## Shutter Problem After Unplugging
**Q:** Okay, I left it unplugged, and the problem has changed: now it won’t stay open. When I run a test trial, the shutter opens when it’s supposed to and then immediately closes, then opens and slowly closes again when it’s supposed to close.  
**A:** The checkbox for the Davis rig needs to be checked.

## Licking sensitivity
**Q:** When the animal isn't at the spout or licking the bottle, a lick is being registered.  
**A:** Check the latency of the lick and if it happens on another trial the sensitivity may be set too high. To fix this look at the value of the turnable knob on the tan box. The normal value should be 5.5.

## Bottle weight doesn't change
**Q:** After the experiment even though the animal was registering licks the bottle weight did not change.  
**A:** This is likely due to the air in the spout preventing the liquid from coming down into the spout. Even when properly "charging" or shaking out the spout this can sometimes happen. Make sure there is no air in the spout thoroughly.

## VNC Remote Access Issue
**Q:** The computer has restarted, and now I can’t remote in.  
**A:** TightVNC must allow access. Check if the square is activated. If not, open TightVNC and allow remote access.

## No Remote Access on VNC Viewer
**Q:** I don’t have remote access on VNC Viewer.  
**A:** Set up by adding the IP in as shown.
