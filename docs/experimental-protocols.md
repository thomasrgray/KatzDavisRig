# Pre-Exposure Begins - Day 12

Make fresh daily  
Use a graduated cylinder to measure 100mL of DI/miliQ water. Add to an amber 100mL bottle. In the fume hood, select odorant. Use a p10 to carefully pipette 10µL of odorant into the 100mL bottle (pipette up and down to mix). Cap the 100mL bottle and shake. Label with animal ID and odor. Remove ad lib water bottle. Place lick spout with ball into amber bottle and into animal cage at the same time daily (within the same hour timepoint). Measure and record water consumption by the animal. Record Start/Stop Date and Odor on Pre-exposure cage card. **REMEMBER:** Label the bottle with the date made and solution clearly. Keep the tape tag in your lab notebook after remaking it each day.

**Odors are given to the animal in the home cage for 3 days total, with only one odor presented for the 3 days.**

### Odors:
- Methyl valerate
- Ethyl butyrate

**Add infused water (0.01% concentration of each odor) into the home cage:**
- 100mL of cis-3-hex in XX concentration in conical tube with spout, remove ad lib water.
- Unenriched animals also get conical tube and spout.

Remain until water deprivation starts on Day 16, end of BAT hab 2.

## Habituation (hab) in BAT - Days 15-19

- **Weigh animals daily**
- **Clean rig** thoroughly with 70% EtOH, allow 10min to air out between animals.
- **Fresh lick spouts** used for each animal.
- **MiliQ water fresh** on hab 1.

### Hab 1
- Rig habituation, no shutter or tastants.  
- 30 min, fan on.

### Hab 2
- Rig habituation, no shutter or tastants.  
- 30 min, fan on, **Water restriction starts.**

### Hab 3
- Licking Habituation: shutter open with 1 water bottle (stink_hab3), 30 min.  
- Fan on, **9 am**, give 10-15 mL of water.

### Hab 4
- 2 bottles water - 30 trials, 15 each bottle (stink_hab4).  
- Fan on, **9 am**, give 10-15 mL of water.

### Hab 5
- 2 bottles water - 30 trials, 15 each bottle (stink_hab5).  
- Fan on, **9 am**, give 10-15 mL of water.

## Make Tastants for Preference Tests (Pre and Post):

### Bottles:
- 20mL MiliQ water  
- 20mL MiliQ water

- 20mL 0.01% Carvone (2µL Carvone + 20mL distilled water)  
- 20mL 0.01% cis-3-hexen-1-ol (2µL cis-3-hexen-1-ol + 20mL distilled water)  
- 20mL 0.01% cis-3-hexen-1-ol (2µL cis-3-hexen-1-ol + 20mL distilled water)

### Presentations:
- 48 presentations of 6 bottles (10 presentations each; hab4/5 = 2 bottles presented 15 times)
  - **Lick time:** 5s  
  - **IPI:** 30s  
  - **Max wait time:** 60s  
  - **Session time limit:** 100 min  
- Store tastants in glass bottles.

## **Conditioning Days - 2 Bottle Protocol**

**Make fresh daily:**

### Paired odor:
- 20mL miliQ (DI water) with 2µL paired odor + 1.37g sucrose.
- 50mL miliQ with 5µL paired odor + 3.423g sucrose.

### Unpaired odor:
- 20mL miliQ (DI water) with 2µL odor.
- 50mL miliQ with 5µL odor.

### Conditioning Days 1/3/5 (Paired odor):
- **Bottles:**  
  0.2M sucrose + paired odor.

### Conditioning Days 2/4/6 (Unpaired odor):
- **Bottles:**  
  2µL unpaired odor in 20mL distilled water.

### Presentations:
- 30 presentations of 2 bottles (15 each).  
  - **Lick time:** 5s  
  - **IPI:** 30s  
  - **Max wait time:** 60s  
  - **Session time limit:** 100 min  

---

## **Post-Preference Tests - Days 27-28**

- 6 bottles: 2 bottles water, 2 bottles Carvone, 2 bottles cis-3-hexen-1-ol.  
- 42 trials, 7 each bottle (stink_prepref_test1).  
- Fan on, **9 am**, give 10-15 mL of water.

## **Running the Experiment**

**⚠️ See LASER use SOP for detailed laser instructions**

### Preparation:
- Make odors daily (paired or unpaired). Use miliQ (di-H2O).
- Turn on the laser but do not turn the key to "on" yet. Let it warm up for at least 15 min.
- Fill bottles appropriately and label with tastant. Ensure spouts are working by checking for liquid output.

---

### Computer Setup:
- Use the icon with "data collection" to start.
- Select the `.pro` file from the drop-down menu (e.g., hab4, test, etc.), and press "show" to check correctness.
- Run the experiment using the sequence from the `.pro` file (e.g., stink_con_paired1).
- Ensure the correct bottle presentations (2,1,2,1, etc.) and that licks are being counted correctly.

---

### During the Experiment:
- Weigh the animal, connect optic fibers for laser days.
- Adjust laser output to match fiber requirements.
- Run the experiment for 25-30 min, saving data and weighing bottles afterward.

**Note:** Clean all equipment thoroughly between animals.
